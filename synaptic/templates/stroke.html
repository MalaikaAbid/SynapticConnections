            <p class="text-left">For our brain cells to function properly, they require a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients that are
delivered to the brain through our blood. When blood flow to the brain becomes compromised by a blockage in
a blood vessel that supplies the brain (ischemic) or by the bursting of a blood vessel in the brain (hemorrhagic),
brain cells that do not receive enough nutrients begin to die, resulting in a stroke. In most cases, the stroke will
only affect a portion of the brain, which is why symptoms tend to differ from patient to patient. Because of the
way the brain is wired, strokes that occur in the right side of the brain commonly affect function of the left side
of the body, and vice versa.</p>
